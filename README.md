# Godot4 PinJoint RopePhysics
An implementation of rope physics using Path3D nodes to procedurally generate geometry, and PinJoint3D nodes to approximate rope physics.
- Play the demo here on itch.io: https://palin-drome.itch.io/godot-4-3d-pinjoint-rope-physics
## Script usage instructions:
- Add a path_3d_rope.tscn node to your scene
- Change curve3D to your desired shape
- Change the number of segments based on the shape and length of the curve
- Adjust the number of sides the mesh has, and its thickness
- Choose to fix in place the ends of the rope by selecting, or attach rigid bodies to the ends of the rope by slecting a node
- Lastly you can change the material the procedurally generated mesh uses
- Then you can just run the project, and a rope will be procedurally generated from the Path3D
